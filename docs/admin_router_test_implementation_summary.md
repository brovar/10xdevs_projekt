# Admin Router Tests Implementation Summary

## Test File Structure

The admin router test implementation in `tests/test_admin_router.py` follows a structured approach with:

1. **Imports and setup**: Required modules, constants, and test client setup
2. **Mock classes**: StubUserService, StubLogService, StubOfferService, StubOrderService, and mock database session
3. **Fixtures**: Authentication and dependency overrides
4. **Test cases**: Organized by endpoint

## Key Implementation Details

### Stub Services

The test file implements four stub service classes that replace the actual services:

1. **StubUserService**: Mocks user operations like listing, retrieving, blocking, and unblocking users
2. **StubLogService**: Mocks logging operations and auditing
3. **StubOfferService**: Mocks offer management including moderation
4. **StubOrderService**: Mocks order operations including retrieval and cancellation

Each stub service implements:
- `_reset()` method to clear call history between tests
- `_record_call()` to track method calls and arguments
- `_maybe_raise()` to optionally raise exceptions for error testing
- Default return values that simulate expected service responses

### Authentication Mocking

The test suite overrides the authentication dependencies to simulate different auth contexts:

```python
# Mock require_authenticated dependency to return user data for tests
async def mock_require_authenticated():
    if not current_user_data:
        raise HTTPException(
            status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
             detail={"error_code": "NOT_AUTHENTICATED", "message": "UÅ¼ytkownik nie jest zalogowany."}
        )
    return {...}  # User dict with role, ID, etc.

# Mock require_admin dependency to enforce admin role checks
async def mock_require_admin():
    user_dict = await mock_require_authenticated()
    if user_dict["user_role"] != UserRole.ADMIN:
        raise HTTPException(
            status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail={"error_code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS", "message": "Admin role required"}
        )
    return user_dict
```

Fixtures control the current authenticated user:
- `buyer_auth`: Set authenticated user to buyer role
- `seller_auth`: Set authenticated user to seller role
- `no_auth`: Set no authenticated user (unauthenticated)
- Default is admin role for most tests

### Mock Database Session

The database session is mocked with a `SimpleNamespace` object that provides methods like:
- `add`, `commit`, `refresh`, `get`, `rollback`, `flush`, `execute`

SQLAlchemy query results are simulated with the `MockResult` class that emulates:
- `scalars()`, `scalar()`, `all()`, and `first()` methods

### CSRF Protection

CSRF protection is mocked for endpoints that require it:
- Default mock bypasses CSRF validation for normal tests
- Special implementations used for CSRF failure testing

```python
class MockCsrfProtect:
    async def validate_csrf_in_cookies(self, request: Request):
        pass  # Bypass check

class FailingMockCsrfProtect:
    async def validate_csrf_in_cookies(self, request: Request):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail={"error_code": "INVALID_CSRF", "message": "CSRF token missing or invalid"}
        )
```

## Test Categories

The 64 test functions follow these categories:

1. **User Management Tests (20 tests)**
   - List users (success, auth, filters, errors)
   - Get user details (success, auth, not found, errors)
   - Block user (success, auth, not found, already inactive, errors)
   - Unblock user (success, auth, not found, already active, errors)

2. **Offer Management Tests (20 tests)**
   - List offers (success, auth, filters, errors)
   - Moderate offer (success, auth, not found, already moderated, errors)
   - Unmoderate offer (success, auth, not found, not moderated, errors)

3. **Order Management Tests (14 tests)**
   - List orders (success, auth, filters, errors)
   - Cancel order (success, auth, not found, already cancelled, errors)

4. **Log Management Tests (10 tests)**
   - List logs (success, auth, filters, errors)
   - Date handling (invalid date formats)

## Testing Approach

The test implementation follows these patterns:

1. **Configuration over code**: Tests use stubs with configurable behavior rather than complex test logic
2. **Call verification**: Tests verify that services were called with correct parameters
3. **State verification**: Tests check logs created during operations
4. **Separate concerns**: Authentication, validation, and business logic tests are separate
5. **Comprehensive coverage**: All endpoints, parameters, and error conditions are tested

## Error Testing Strategy

The implementation uses a consistent approach for testing errors:

1. **HTTP exceptions**: Configure stub services to raise appropriate exceptions
2. **Validation errors**: Test with invalid parameters
3. **Resource state errors**: Test conflict conditions
4. **Unexpected errors**: Simulate server errors with generic exceptions

## Test Implementation Statistics

- **Lines of code**: ~1,100 lines 
- **Test functions**: 64 tests
- **Mocked components**: 7 (authentication, CSRF, database, 4 services)
- **Fixtures**: 4 (admin/seller/buyer/no auth)
- **HTTP status codes tested**: 6 (200, 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 500)

## Running the Tests

To run just the admin router tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_admin_router.py -v
```

To run with coverage report:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=src.routers.admin_router tests/test_admin_router.py
```
